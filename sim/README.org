* Overview

Setting up 4 simulation environments is in order:

| Plan Size | Characteristics |
|-----------+-----------------|
| Small     | 1024 users      |
| Medium    | 10000 users     |
| Large     | 40000 users     |
| Humongous | 100k users      |

** IP address ranges

	2001:0002::/48 and 198.18.0.0/15 are the experimental address ranges.
	For testing outside of the network, perhaps a BGP AS for this would help

** DNS service
	nsupdate for reverse dns? Hosts file?

* Subscriber Plans
| Plan Name | Down   |      Up |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----------+--------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---|
|           | 4Mbit  | 384kbit |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|           | 10Mbit |   1Mbit |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|           | 20Mbit |     384 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|           | 25Mbit |     384 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|           | 50MBit |     384 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|           | 60Mbit |     384 |   |   |   |   |   |   |

* Topologies 

A variety of topologies need to be emulated.

** Distance
** Hops
** Different technologies

* Routing Protocols

Both ISIS and OSPF are in use

* Underlying framing

PPPoe, MPLS are in use
CGNATs might become an issue
IPv6 deploying?

* Transport Technologies
| Plan                 | Down | Up  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|----------------------+------+-----+---+---+---+---+---+---|
| WiFi                 |      |     |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Cable                | 2ms  | 6ms |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Docsis LL            | 1ms  |     |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Wireless half duplex |      |     |   |   |   |   |   |   |

* Diffserv Markings
  EF,LE,CS1, CS5,NQB,CS6

* Failure Modes
** AQM
fq_codel was not designed to be a middlebox. The FQ component works well,
the AQM component, doesn't work as well as it could.

Similarly, many devices are themselves the bottleneck, still, so they
accumulate a ton of RTT themselves, and monitoring the RTT and doing
something about it would possibly help. 

** FQ

** Encapsulations

** HTB is bursty
