* Overview

Setting up 4 simulation environments is in order:

| Plan Size | Characteristics |
|-----------+-----------------|
| Small     | 1024 users      |
| Medium    | 10000 users     |
| Large     | 40000 users     |
| Humongous | 100k users      |

** IP address ranges

	2001:0002::/48 and 198.18.0.0/15 are the experimental address ranges.
	For testing outside of the network, perhaps a BGP AS for this would help

** DNS service
	nsupdate for reverse dns? Hosts file?

* Topologies 

A variety of topologies need to be emulated.

** Distance
** Hops
** Different technologies

* Routing Protocols

Both ISIS and OSPF are in use

* Underlying framing

PPPoe, MPLS are in use
CGNATs might become an issue
IPv6 deploying?

* Transport Technologies

* Failure Modes
** AQM
fq_codel was not designed to be a middlebox. The FQ component works well,
the AQM component, doesn't work as well as it could.

[[./img/middlebox_compared.png]]

Similarly, many devices are themselves the bottleneck, still, so they
accumulate a ton of RTT themselves, and monitoring the RTT and doing
something about it would possibly help. 

Validating the the RTT metrics reported by pping line up with the
actual measurements from actual flows is important. Also, what are
the effects of ack-filtering on pping?

** FQ

The FQ methods we use are really good for most traffic types, and
could be even better if more applications did single packet pacing and
were more sensitive to delay and jitter.

** Encapsulations

We have no insight into QUIC or VPN traffic. This is going to get
worse over time. The only thing we have for quic is the: [[https://www.ietfjournal.org/enabling-internet-measurement-with-the-quic-spin-bit/][spin bit]] -
which is probably [[https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/quic/quic-spinbit][not widely implemented]]. The best insight we actually
have is queue accomulation and packet drop/mark behaviors.


** HTB is bursty

** DSCP

What DSCPs are in common use today?

** DROP_MONITOR

We have 2600 (not kidding, 2600) places where packet
