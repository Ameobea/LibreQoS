# LibreQoS
![Banner](docs/Banner.png "Banner")
LibreQoS is a python application that allows you to apply fq_codel traffic shaping to hundreds of customers. <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/">Fq_codel</a> is a Free and Open Source Active Queue Management algorithm that reduces bufferbloat, and can improve the quality of customer connections significantly. LibreQoS features the ability to import devices from LibreNMS and UNMS at runtime using API calls. It then apples hundreds of filter rules to direct customer traffic through individual fq_codel instances within an <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc-htb">HTB</a> (HTB+fq_codel). By utilizing <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.adv-filter.hashing.html">hashing filters</a>, thousands of rules can be applied with minimal impact on traffic throughput or CPU use. This is alpha software, please do not deploy in production without thorough testing.
## Features
* HTB + fq_codel
* Experimental support for CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced)
* TC filters divided into groups with hashing filters to significantly increase efficiency and minimize resource use
   * VM running LibreQoS with 2500 IP rules uses just 1.5GB RAM total
* Basic statistics (Top 10 CPEs experiencing packet loss)
## Integration
* LibreNMS device import
* UNMS/UCRM device import
## Requirements
* Edge and Core routers with MTU 1500 on links between them
   * If you use MPLS, you would terminate MPLS traffic at the core router. LibreQoS cannot decapsulate MPLS on its own.
* OSPF primary link (low cost) through the server running LibreQoS
* OSPF backup link

### Server Requirements
* VM or physical server
* One management network interface, completely seperate from the traffic shaping interface NIC. Can be NATed behind motherboard Gigabit Ethernet, that's fine.
* Network interface NIC supporting two virtual interfaces for traffic shaping (in/out), preferably SFP+ capable
  * <a href="https://www.fs.com/products/75600.html">Intel X710</a> recommended for anything over 1Gbps.
* Python 3
  * pip install ipaddress
* Recent Linux kernel for up-to-date linux tc package. Ubuntu Server 20.04.1+ recommended
### VM Performance
#### Memory use
On ProxMox VMs you need to do <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/asakcb/problem_with_ram_cache/">some tweaks</a>  to allow freed up memory to be reclaimed by the hypervisor. Generally memory use should be under 2GB if you have less than 2000 hosts. If for any reason memory exceeds what it should be, try
```
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
```
#### Disable Offloading in Guest VM
Performance can greatly benefit from disabling certain hardware offloading inside the guest VM. If you're using a system that uses Netplan (e.g. Ubuntu) to configure the network then you can use a Netplan post-up script to configure offloading. You create a script in the following directory with a name prefixed by a number to indicate load order e.g. /etc/networkd-dispatcher/routable.d/40-offloading-config - which is executable and owned by root. e.g. To switch off TCP Segment Offloading on eth0:
```
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/ethtool -K eth0 tso off
```
### Add a bridge between in/out interface NICs
* Add linux interface bridge br0 to the two dedicated interfaces
    * For example on Ubuntu Server 20.04 which uses NetPlan, you would add the following to the .yaml file in /etc/netplan/
```
bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces:
           - eth4
           - eth5
```
## Run LibreQoS
* Modify setting parameters in ispConfig.py to suit your environment
* Run:
```
sudo python3 ./LibreQoS.py
```
## Statistics
Basic statistics are now available by running
```
python3 ./stats.py
```
after successful execution of ./LibreQoS.py or ./scheduled.py
## Running as a service
You can use the scheduled.py file to set the time of day you want the shapers to be refreshed at after the initial run.
On linux distributions that use systemd, such as Ubuntu, add the following to /etc/systemd/system/LibreQoS.service
```
[Unit]
After=network.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/$USER/LibreQoSDirectory
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/$USER/LibreQoSDirectory/scheduled.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
Then run
```
sudo systemctl start LibreQoS.service
```
## Real World Performance
This customer is using a Ubiquiti LTU-LR CPE with QoS shaping applied at 215Mbps down and 30Mbps up.
