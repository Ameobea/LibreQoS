# LibreQoS
A tool to traffic shape hundreds of clients and reduce bufferbloat using fq_codel. Features device import integration with LibreNMS and UNMS. This is alpha software, please do not deploy in production without thorough testing.

## Lab Requirements
* Edge and Core routers with MTU 1500 on links between them
* OSPF primary link (low cost) through the server running LibreQoS
* OSPF backup link recommended

## Server Requirements
* VM or physical server
* One management network interface
* Two dedicated network interface cards, preferably SFP+ capable
* Python 3
* Recent Linux kernel
* recent tc-fq_codel provided by package iproute2

## Server Spec Recommendations
* For up to 1Gbps
    * 4+ CPU cores
    * 6GB RAM
    * 32GB Disk Space
    * Passmark score of 13,000 or more (AMD Ryzen 5 2600 or better)
* For up to 2Gbps
    * 6+ CPU cores
    * 8GB RAM
    * 32GB Disk Space
    * Passmark score of 17,000 or more (AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or better)
* For up to 5Gbps
    * 8+ CPU cores
    * 16GB RAM
    * 32GB Disk Space
    * Passmark score of 23,000 or more (AMD Ryzen 7 3800X or better)
* For up to 10Gbps
    * 16+ CPU cores
    * 32GB RAM
    * 32GB Disk Space
    * Passmark score of 38,000 or more (AMD Ryzen 9 3950X or better)

## Features
* HTB + fq_codel
* Experimental support for CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced)
* TC filters divided into groups with hashing filters to significantly increase efficiency and minimize RAM usage

## Known limitations
* Linux TC filters are apparently not cleared from memory after being removed/disassociated with qdiscs. This leads to gradually increasing memory use. One solution is to reboot the VM or server once a week. With an OSPF setup that would mean just 10 or so total seconds of client downtime per week. Still, there must be a better solution. Please contact me if you know of a way to clear linux tc filters' memory usage without a reboot.

## How to use
* Add linux interface bridge br0 to the two dedicated interfaces
    * For example on Ubuntu Server 20.04 which uses NetPlan, you would add the following to the .yaml file in /etc/netplan/
```
bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces:
           - eth4
           - eth5
```
* Modify setting parameters in LibreQoS.py to suit your environment
* Run:
```
sudo python3 ./LibreQoS.py
```
## Integration
* UNMS/UCRM
