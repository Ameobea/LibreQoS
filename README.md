# LibreQoS
LibreQoS is a python application that allows you to apply fq_codel traffic shaping on hundreds of customers. <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/">Fq_codel</a> is a Free and Open Source Active Queue Management algorithm that reduces bufferbloat, and can improve the quality of customer connections significantly. LibreQoS features the ability to import devices from LibreNMS and UNMS at runtime using API calls. It then apples hundreds of filter rules to direct customer traffic through individual fq_codel instances within an <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc-htb">HTB</a> (HTB+fq_codel). By utilizing <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.adv-filter.hashing.html">hashing filters</a>, thousands of rules can be applied with minimal impact on traffic throughput or CPU use. This is alpha software, please do not deploy in production without thorough testing. If you need a stable paid commercial alternative, please check out <a href="https://www.preseem.com/">Preseem</a>, which has great metrics tools and integration with many CRM and NMS platforms.

## Features
* HTB + fq_codel
* Experimental support for CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced)
* TC filters divided into groups with hashing filters to significantly increase efficiency and minimize resource use
* High-efficiency
* Basic statistics (Top 10 CPEs experiencing packet loss)

## Integration
* LibreNMS device import
* UNMS/UCRM device import

## Requirements
* Edge and Core routers with MTU 1500 on links between them
   * If you use MPLS, you would terminate MPLS traffic at the core router
* OSPF primary link (low cost) through the server running LibreQoS
* OSPF backup link

## Server Requirements
* VM or physical server
* One management network interface
* Two dedicated network interface cards, preferably SFP+ capable
* Python 3
* Recent Linux kernel
* recent tc-fq_codel provided by package iproute2

## Known issues
* Linux TC filters may be left in the memory cache after being removed/disassociated with qdiscs. However, that memory space tends to get overwritten as long as the IP scheme of your network isn't changing constantly somehow. If after a few months you need to clear memory cache, use
```
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
```
On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/asakcb/problem_with_ram_cache/">ProxMox VMs</a> you need to do some tweaks to allow that freed up memory to be reflected on the hypervisor. 
## Adding the bridge between in/out interface NICs
* Add linux interface bridge br0 to the two dedicated interfaces
    * For example on Ubuntu Server 20.04 which uses NetPlan, you would add the following to the .yaml file in /etc/netplan/
```
bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces:
           - eth4
           - eth5
```
## Run LibreQoS
* Modify setting parameters in ispConfig.py to suit your environment
* Run:
```
sudo python3 ./LibreQoS.py
```
## Statistics
Basic statistics are now available by running
```
python3 ./stats.py
```
after successful execution of ./LibreQoS.py or ./scheduled.py
## Running as a service
You can use the scheduled.py file to set the time of day you want the shapers to be refreshed at after the initial run.
On linux distributions that use systemd, such as Ubuntu, add the following to /etc/systemd/system/LibreQoS.service
```
[Unit]
After=network.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/$USER/LibreQoSDirectory
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/$USER/LibreQoSDirectory/scheduled.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
Then run
```
sudo systemctl start LibreQoS.service
```
## Real World Performance
This customer is using a Ubiquiti LTU-LR CPE with QoS shaping applied at 215Mbps down and 30Mbps up.
